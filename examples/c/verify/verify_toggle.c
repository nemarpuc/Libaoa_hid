/* Sends a short, human-observable sequence of Consumer Control taps so a
 * person watching the phone (and, ideally, a second terminal running
 * `adb shell getevent -lt /dev/input/eventN`) can confirm whether each Usage
 * actually reaches Android at all, and if so what it does there.
 *
 * This intentionally tests only Consumer Control Usages (media mute,
 * play/pause, volume, and the "AC New" selector) because every one of them is
 * safe to send unattended: worst case is a volume change or a paused video,
 * both trivially reversible. It deliberately does NOT send System Control
 * Power Down/Sleep/Wake Usages, because those can suspend, lock, or power off
 * the phone mid-test with no way for this program to detect or undo it. If
 * you need to verify a System Control Usage, send it one at a time by hand
 * with the phone screen on and unlocked, watching `getevent` the whole time.
 *
 * Before running: unlock the phone and leave the screen on, ideally with a
 * media app (e.g. a paused video/music track) in the foreground so Play/Pause
 * and Mute have something observable to act on. See docs/QUICKSTART.md for
 * cable/udev setup. Ctrl+C to stop early. */
